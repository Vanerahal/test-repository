				<h2>For the environment</h2>
				<p>It’s true that eating meat doesn’t just harm animals – it can also harm you! Consuming flesh takes a terrible toll on human health, taxing your digestive system and increasing your risk of developing life-threatening disease. Authorities such as the British Medical Association confirm that vegetarians have lower rates of obesity, coronary heart disease and high blood pressure. </br>Find out more here. For some, like Rachel, going vegan was a simple choice. She just wrote, “Common sense”, as her reason. But for others, a variety of events have helped them make the connection and decide to forgo eating animals. Emma L wrote that she “[w]as a veggie nearly all my life, but the badger cull really opened my eyes to the horror of the dairy industry. Never looked back since. Best thing I’ve ever done!” The plight of British badgers as victims of the dairy industry did get many people reconsidering their support for the dairy industry.</p>

				<p>Bovine tuberculosis has been conclusively linked to the movement and intensive rearing of cattle in the meat and dairy industries, and one of the best ways protect badgers is to dump meat and dairy products from our diets, addressing the root of the disease. Suzanne wrote that she “was breastfeeding my little boy and was watching a video on factory farming. It was on piglets breastfeeding from a mum in a tiny metal cage thing. I looked down at my boy and looked at the indignity of the mother and her piglets. From that moment I vowed never to eat meat again. I don’t miss it”.</br>Realising that animals raised for food are sensitive, intelligent individuals who are subjected to exhaustion, pain, boredom, loneliness and fear in their short and miserable lives is perhaps one of the most powerful motivations for going vegan. For some, it is realising that there are really few differences between pigs on factory farms and the dog you grew up with.</p>
